    CPU, RAM, OS, 어플리케이션 등의 조건에 따라 다르다.
    
    Socket도 FD 처럼 관리하지만 OPEN_MAX 값을 변경할 수 있다.
    
    통신할 수 있는 클라이언트 수는 컴퓨터가 버티는 상황까지 가능하다.
    
    즉 클라이언트 소켓의 개수에는 제한이 없다고 보는데 웹서버의 경우 동시에 제대로된 서비스를 제공하기 위해서는 CPU 코어 하나당 250개의 클라이언트가 일반적인 것 같다.
    
    concurrent handling과 concurrent connection은 다른 것 같다. 웹서버는 10000의 동시 접속(concurrent connection)을 다룬다.
    
    - How do high traffic sites service more than 65535 TCP connections? ⭐️✅
        
        But a server can (theoretically) serve 65535 simultaneous connections *per client*.
        
        So in practice the server is only limited by how much CPU power, memory etc. it has to serve requests, not by the number of TCP connections to the server.
        
        +
        
        LImit is 65535 connections per ip address. You can easily add more virtual network interfaces/ virtual ips to the same physical network interface and have 1mln+ connections or more on same server.

    - **How many concurrent TCP connections can a server handle? ⭐️✅**
        
        In the early 2000s, the discussion was about the c10k problem — i.e. whether a server could handle 10,000 concurrent connections. The core bottleneck proved to be `select`
         and this was resolved with the addition of `epoll`
        , this essentially made scaling to 10k connections achievable for well-implemented servers. From then on the practical boundaries have been memory limit, the nature of the application, and quality of the software architecture and implementation. Hardware performance improvement particularly memory and CPU core increases means that 100k connections are practically achievable today when the required software engineering quality is in place.

        A Single CPU core will commonly handle an average of 220 to 250 concurrent connections simultaneously. If for instance, a website runs on a server that has a single CPU with 2 CPU cores, approximately 500 visitors may access and search the website at the same time.

    - ****1,000,000 Concurrent Connections ⭐️⭐️✅****
        
        Each server socket needs two file descriptors:
        
        1. A buffer for sending
        2. A buffer for receiving
        
        1. You can fix this by overriding the file descriptor limits of your OS
        
        1. Practical limit on my 16GB Mac is 80,000
        2. Practical limit on my 8GB Linux is 840,000

        I/O Multiplexing : 여러 소켓에 대해 I/O를 병행적으로 하는 기법. 다수의 프로세스 혹은 스레드를 만들지 않고도 여러 파일을 처리할 수 있기 때문에 less memory, less context switching이 가능해 성능 개선됨.
        
        I/O Multiplexing 기능은 프로그램에서 여러 파일 디스크립터를 모니터링해서 어떤 종류의 I/O 이벤트가 일어났는지 검사하고 각각의 파일 디스크립터가 Ready 상태가 되었는지 인지하는게 주요 목적이다.

        - select()
            
            What `select` does under the hood is, it simply loops through all the file descriptors from `0` to `nfds - 1`. It checks if you have set them and if the desired event occured. So, the runtime is `O(n)` where `n` is the largest file descriptor you’re watching!
            
            The default size FD_SETSIZE (currently 1024) is somewhat smaller than the current kernel limit to the number of open files.
            
            The bigger issue is when it tries to set results for a file descriptor past `1024` and tries to set that bit field in say `readfds`, `writefds` or `errorfds` field. At this point it will write something random on the stack eventually crashing the process and making it very hard to debug what happened since your stack is randomized.
            
        - poll()
            
            poll solved the fd limit of 1024, introduced more flavours of events to watch and slight changes to the timeout in the api, such as using milliseconds instead of microseconds.
            
            Although `poll` is an improvement to `select`, it still loops over the all the provided file descriptors hence runs in `O(n)` where `n`
             is the number of file descriptors we are watching.
            
        - kqueue()
            
            [Kqueue](https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue) is a scalable event notification interface introduced in 2000. It provides a standard API for applications to register their interest in various events/conditions and have their notifications delivered efficiently. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, reliable and correct.
